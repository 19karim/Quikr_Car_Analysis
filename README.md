**Quikr Car Analysis and Prediction**

Overview:

This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting car prices based on data obtained from Quikr. The dataset includes information about various car attributes such as company, year, price, kilometers driven, and fuel type.

Project Structure:

data: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis and prediction. Ensure that the dataset is stored in a file named quikr_car_data.csv.

src: The source code for the analysis and prediction is stored in this directory. The main file is quikr_car_analysis.ipynb, a Jupyter Notebook that guides through the steps of loading, exploring, and predicting car prices.

Dataset:

The dataset (quikr_car_data.csv) contains the following columns:

name: The model name of the car.
company: The manufacturing company of the car.
year: The manufacturing year of the car.
Price: The price of the car.
kms_driven: The total kilometers driven by the car.
fuel_type: The type of fuel the car uses.

Linear Regression and Data Preprocessing:

The notebook includes a Linear Regression model to predict car prices. Additionally, it performs data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for optimal model performance.

Data Visualization:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using data visualization techniques. Various graphs and charts are generated to better understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (Price). This helps in gaining insights into the dataset.

Model Persistence using Pickle:

The trained Linear Regression model is saved using the Pickle library for future use. This allows for easy deployment and reuse of the model without the need to retrain it.

Results:

After running the analysis and prediction steps, you will obtain insights into the factors influencing car prices, a predictive model for estimating car prices, and visualizations for better interpretation.
